	<faction.thal_confederacy>The Europan Confederacy</faction.thal_confederacy>
	<faction.thal_confederacy.description>The Europan Confederacy is a more moral offshoot of the notorious Jovian Seperatists. After the great recession, various outposts confederated together to advocate for increased freedoms, which caused the Coalition to declare war. The Jovian Seperatists and Confederacy disagree on their methods: While the Jovian Seperatists will resort to terrorism to combat the Coalition, the Confederacy generally tries to harm fewer innocents.</faction.thal_confederacy.description>
	<faction.thal_confederacy.shortdescription> League of seperatist outposts that formally declared secession from the Coalition, who branded them traitors. Firm believers in individual rights, they fight in a direct war unlike the insurgent Jovian Seperatists.</faction.thal_confederacy.shortdescription>
	
	<faction.thal_cartel>Cthonian Cartel</faction.thal_cartel>
	<faction.thal_cartel.description>The Cthonian Cartel is the face of Europa's sprawling criminal underworld. It is unknown if Cthonian refers to the lovecraftian monsters under the ice, or the 'underworld' from which the cartel originates. In some areas with limited coalition presence, the cartel acts as an authority.</faction.thal_cartel.description>

	<jobname.thal_clown>Clown</jobname.thal_clown>
	<jobdescription.thal_clown>Clowns are the comical oddballs employed to entertain the crew. Their job is not to necessarily aid the ship, but rather aid the crews boredom through harmless antics and pranks. Have a tomfoolery stat that determines their effectiveness with... things. If your games are getting a little boring on the social side, consider one of the clown variants.</jobdescription.thal_clown>

	<jobdescription.thal_clown1>The jester is the classic performer, always scheming. They spawn with basic clowning gear as well as a fabricator that allows them to make a variety of hysterical pranking gear from odds and ends they find around the ship. Notably, they are quite skilled with balloons and can make surprisingly functional balloon sculptures.</jobdescription.thal_clown1>
	<jobdescription.thal_clown2>Honkchildren, part cultist and part shaman, are the cunning followers of the Children of the Honkmother. Sworn in under the Honkly Juggaloath, they are loyal devotees to the honkmother. If spirit rituals, blood pacts, and creature summoning sound fun, choose this.</jobdescription.thal_clown2>
	<jobdescription.thal_clown3>Mimes are unable to speak but possess various superpowers that make them faster, sturdier, stronger, and capable of affecting/irritating other players.</jobdescription.thal_clown3>

This job requires you to strap on your respirator to create and maintain highly toxic environments to get rich quick.</jobdescription.thal_scientist1>
	
	<jobdescription.thal_scientist2>For those with a god complex, Geneticist allows you to toy with your subjects on a genetic level.
